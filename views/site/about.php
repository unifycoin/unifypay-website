        UnifyPay was founded in 2017, while Unifycoin was still in its infancy. We saw the potential for unifycoin to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale.
    </h4>
    <p>
        We started UnifyPay because we wanted to make it easy for businesses to accept unifycoin payments. We are currently the largest unifycoin payment processor in the world, serving industry-leading merchants on six continents. We've created a seamless, secure unifycoin payment experience used daily by hundreds of thousands of unifycoin users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment processing was our first contribution to the Unifycoin ecosystem, but it is not our last. With Unifycore, we're building an open source platform to power the next applications of Unifycoin. The UnifyPay secure unifycoin wallet is giving consumers a powerful toolkit for getting started right with unifycoin payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unifycoin's future looks very bright, and we plan on remaining on the forefront of this technology, creating more tools and services for everyone to use in innovative new ways.
