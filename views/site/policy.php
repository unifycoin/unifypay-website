                <p>This notice describes the ways UnifyPay, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“UnifyPay,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collect, store,
                    use and protects a user’s (“User(s),” “you,” or “your”) personal information. The purpose of this notice is to
                    ensure that UnifyPay complies with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union
                    (EU) data protection laws, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection. UnifyPay’s products include
                    the UnifyPay App and Copay Unifycoin wallet applications, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities
                    (“Products”) offered by UnifyPay, Inc.</p>
                <p>There is one type of user whose personal information we may process:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Users that download and use our Products.</li>
                </ol>
                <p></p>
                <p>Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Products.</p>
                <h2 id="personal-info" data-magellan-destination="personal-info">What is “personally identifiable information?”</h2>
                <p>“Personally identifiable information” (“personal information”) is any information that can be directly associated
                    with a particular person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information
                    is a person’s name. In some instances, such as the EU directive, an email or IP address can be viewed as personal
                    information. </p>
                <h2 id="kind-of-info" data-magellan-destination="kind-of-info">What information we do collect</h2>
                <p>UnifyPay does not collect users personal information unless the user enables “email notifications.” Once a user selects
                    “Enable email notifications” in the settings section of the product, UnifyPay will store a user’s email address
                    on our servers. If enabled, UnifyPay could have access to view the balance and transaction history of a wallet
                    and link it to a user’s email address. Lastly, UnifyPay always keeps access logs to our servers, which contain
                    IP address, time, access details. </p>
                <p>UnifyPay does not collect any third party integrations within the product (such as Unifycoin exchange or any other integrations).
                    It is crucial to note that private keys are never transmitted to UnifyPay’s servers, so it is not possible for
                    UnifyPay to access a user’s Unifycoin in any case. </p>
                <h2 id="why-collect" data-magellan-destination="why-collect">Why we collect email address</h2>
                <p>Our primary purpose for collecting an email address is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized
                    experience. We may use your email address to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>send notices about your transactions.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 id="protecting-info" data-magellan-destination="protecting-info">How we protect and store personal information</h2>
                <p>We store and process your email address on our computers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where UnifyPay
                    facilities are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance
                    with applicable US federal and state regulations, and EU data protection laws.</p>
                <p>We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings
                    and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill
                    their job responsibilities.</p>
                <h2 id="third-parties" data-magellan-destination="third-parties">How we share personal information with third parties</h2>
                <p>We may share your personal information with: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>other UnifyPay entities, to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and
                        to guide decisions about our products, services, and communications;</li>
                    <li>law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal
                        process or requirement applicable to UnifyPay; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure
                        of an email address is necessary to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our
                        Terms of Use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information
                    may be less stringent than in your country.</p>
